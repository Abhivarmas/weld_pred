# Prediction of welding defects by using machine learning algorithm
Created an ML model to predict welding defects in the materials by developing 
algorithms using process parameters such as ambient temperature, voltage,current 
etc..random forest algorithm is used here for developing the model.libaries used in 
this project is numpy,pandas,sklearn,and flask for the webpage.heroku is used here 
for deployement of webpage.

here we have 3 class.the name is given as below.
(1)No defect
(2)Tungsten Inclusion
(3)Porosity
